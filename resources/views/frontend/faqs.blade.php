		    				<p>Is everything done on a Smartphone?</p>
		    				<p>
		    					As our name Forsalebyweb.com implies, virtually everything will be performed by text, email, and internet.  Your agent will meet you only when showing or inspecting homes.  There's no APP to download.  Internet access is all you need.

		    					We Guarantee Faster Service & More Cashback Than Any Real Estate Company In America!

		    				<p><strong>How do I get started?</strong></p>

							<p>
								Simply click "Find Agent" at the top of page and complete form or send a text message.  You will be contacted with step-by-step instructions:
							</p>

							<ol>
								<li>
									When you are ready, a local agent will contact you and you will be asked to sign electronically a Real Estate Disclosure Form acknowledging that you understand Forsalebyweb.com is a licensed real estate company.
								</li><br>
								<li>
									Upon receipt, you will receive instructions on signing electronically a Representation agreement that pays you all the commission at closing less fees for your showings.
								</li><br>
								<li>
									Upon receipt, you will be assigned a licensed agent and contact to work with you.
								</li><br>
								<li>
									You will receive instructions to register access to our client portal.
								</li><br>
								<li>
									You will continue to communicate with your agent via Smartphone, texting, email, and client portal.
								</li>
							</ol>

							<p>It's that easy!</p>


							<p><strong>How are you paid?</strong></p>


							<p>
								Our agents will refund you 100% of the traditional commission that they normally earn, less your fee for showings.
							</p>


							<p><strong>How much is your showing fee? </strong></p>

							<p>
								Each home has a different cost per showing which is determined by price and market condition.  Your agent will disclose the exact fee per showing before signing a Representation contract.
							</p>

							<p><strong>How can Forsalebyweb.com pay me ( lets me keep all the commissions )?</strong></p>
							<p>
								Forsalebyweb.com incentivizes you to use your Smartphone or Internet to save us time.  Our agents can provide faster & more efficient service to more clients in less time.  We can complete work in a fraction of the time that traditional real estate agents charge to be "on call".

							</p>

							<p><strong>As a seller, do you start by paying me 6% to list my house and then deduct per showing fees from this?</strong></p>


							<p>Yes!</p>


							<p><strong>Is it legal to keep all my agent's Commission?</strong></p>

							<p>
								Absolutely! Not only is it legal but the United States Government through the U.S. Department of Justice and the FTC have been fighting for consumers since 2005 to have this day. The battle and confusion between discount brokers, limited service brokers, and full service brokers are over with the advent of technology and your mobile phones. Now, virtually every aspect of the home buying and selling process can be executed by the Smartphone.
							</p>


							<p><strong>Do I have the same access to MLS properties and buyers as traditional real estate companies?</strong></p>

							<p>
								Absolutely! You have access to the same properties and buyers across thousands of real estate Websites.  Our proprietary process actually brings more buyers to every home we sell.
							</p>


							<p><strong>Is it secure and safe to use Forsalebyweb.com?</strong></p>
							<p>
								Unlike real estate transaction management systems and other file transferring services, Forsalebyweb.com transactions are fully encrypted and transmitted so that the contents of the files being transferred cannot be known by others. To receive and download a file, a 6-digit key must be provided by the Sender. No files are stored on our servers or third-party servers because files get deleted immediately after they are downloaded by the receiver. So you do not have to worry about file leaks or data breach.
							</p>

							<p><strong>I love your service, but I still need a traditional real estate agent to hold my hand.</strong></p>

							<p>
								No problem!  We're so sure that you will love the benefits of Smartphone home selling that we'll switch you to our Traditional service and include the Forsalebyweb.com PROCESS free of charge at anytime.
							</p>


							<p><strong>What is the mission and purpose of Forsalebyweb.com?</strong></p>

							<p>
								Our mission and purpose began in 2003 when the internet was relatively new for most consumers. We began by asking the simple question, “How do we make home buying and selling easier, faster, and safer for all?”  The answer:  It's in Your Phone®
