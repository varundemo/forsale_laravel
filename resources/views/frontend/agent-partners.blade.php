								Forsalebyweb.com is the leading ( and only ) smartphone home selling and smartphone home buying real estate company in the United States.  You might not know about us yet, but we're quietly revolutionizing the real estate industry without the headache of venture capitalists, franchising, or building real estate companies across the United States.  We've determined that the best way to share the Forsalebyweb.com model is through Real Estate Agent Partners who already understand the current market dynamics, opportunities, and recognize the future of real estate is inside the Smartphone.
							</p>

							<p>
								According to the National Association of Realtors®  76% of consumers ( and growing daily ) find their home on a mobile device.  Our Mission is to connect these modernized consumers with real estate professionals everywhere!
							</p>

							<p><strong>What is a Forsalebyweb.com Partner?</strong></p>

								We are looking for professionals who are aligned with our mission of speeding up the home buying and selling process.  Our 7-step P-R-O-C-E-S-S includes working with realty professionals who we send referrals to regularly.  You must be licensed and in good standing with the local Realtor®  Association and State Commerce Authorities.

								</li><br>
								<li>
									We do charge a one-time training and setup fee of $997/agent ( contact for entire brokerage) to ensure you understand our business model and process and are committed to achieving the same mission.
